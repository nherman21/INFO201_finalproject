# INFO201_finalproject

For our INFO 201 Final Project, we are choosing to analyze Spotify's Top Songs.

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
As typical Spotify users, our group is intrigued by how Spotifyâ€™s algorithmic technology chooses the Top Songs in our playlists. Because we interact with this app in a daily basis and we use Spotify's automatic playlists, we have decided to analyze what makes certain songs popular and better than other songs. This includes the analysis of how Spotify makes personalized playlists for us, and how it measures certain trends in songs we play.
