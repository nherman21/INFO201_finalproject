```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Here, we are trying to analyse which are the most popular genres and hence a bar chart has been created to show the genres streamed the most by people. Here, we can see that Dance Pop and Pop are the most popular genres. This is done to understand what kind of music is listened to by the most number of people. It seems that most people like songs that are good to dance to. 

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Chart_2 <- ggplot(data = top_50) + geom_bar( mapping = aes(x = Genre, fill = "#FF6666" )) + theme(
  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle("Most popular Genres")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
